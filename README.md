# ObjectTracking
Details

1. Review related paper for RCNN Based object tracking approach.

2. We will focus on this RCNN BASED approach to build up our own version, 
    Data will be using MOT15 or MOT17.
    - Set up your training environment 
    - Test our deepSort to help you get familiar on the dataset

    - Code:  https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort

3. Implementation  for the RCNN based approach based on previous reading
    Try to implement 2 version
    - 1st, Faster RCNN based
    - 2nd, Mask RCNN Based (after Fully tested the first one and worked, and when you have extra time, do this)

4. Test our model on MOT dataset, record all necessary data, Loss, accrurcy, generate result for visulization
5. Compare result with DeepSort
